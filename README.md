# Streamlit demo page
The following script was created to demonstrate the loader_yolo project. In the Logistics Center, automated warehouse robots, called Loaders, handle the storage and retrieval of products, and their precise operation is supported by a camera system. The previous script, which relied on traditional edge-detection methods, produced too many errors, necessitating an alternative solution. The YOLO Object Detection model can run on a Raspberry Pi unit with adequate performance and good accuracy.
The following test website ( [YOLO DEMO PAGE](https://fiokapp.streamlit.app/) ) was created for the other stakeholders in the project to showcase the capabilities of the model.

All the code and documentation related to the project can be found in the following GitHub repository: [Loader YOLO project](https://github.com/mecalis/loader_yolo)
